      He looked back and asked       himself, how did you do it?
      This had been a recurring question over the past days and he struggled to find an answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Was it God?
    </p>

    <p>
      Was it determination or sheer luck?
    </p>

    <p> 
      One thing was quite certain, his   life had been one hell of a ride.
      He used to be homeless yet he had a lot of friends, it took him aback.
      He remained homeless.

    <p>
      To survive, you have to be a fox to recognize the traps and a lion to frighten the wolves, how then would you survive if you are in the wild unprepared?

      He learned to be tough on the streets where there is no love and as the street saying goes, “no padi for jungle”…… but sometimes you want love and affection, who best to give that if not the mother? 
    </p>

    <p>
      He found comfort in weed and drugs but it’s a slow death, only if he hadn’t witnessed firsthand the damage they could cause, he would always indulge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A seeming fox, frightening like a lion is dangerous, one opening and you are torn apart, but with bravado, you just might survive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Sometimes he found love and it was beautiful but it turned sour just when he started to get comfortable, which taught him a single lesson, if it’s not the mother, it’s not genuine and you can’t be comfortable.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Slow and steady he moved and he always hoped he would get the love and comfort he craved from the only source whenever he needed it, unfortunately for him death had a different plan. At a time his father struggled with pain and regret, he learned painful lessons of pride and humility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Losing that one genuine love was quite tough, he then realized that he had no other choice than to get used to it and the comfort he craved was only within himself.
