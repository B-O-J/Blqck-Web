      There will come a time when you question if God really exists but it is wise to understand this is the period where you have to hold on to the faith the most.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Truth is hard times are inevitable, even more so than the good times and you wonder why that is? Life is a test and it is all on you to fail or not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Why are we tested, is it necessary, you wonder? All you have to do is try not to fail because it is when the times are hard, questions abound. We complain when times are hard but rejoice and forget itâ€™s all a test when the times are good.
      We always think we should be bigger or be in a better position but instead of complaining, why not reflect on your life up until the present and ask yourself if you have been lucky or unlucky?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There, your questions might be answered and you find that what really matters is gratitude.
