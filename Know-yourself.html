      Behave like them but do not become them; what a life, what a burden! It is both demanding and exhausting remaining a self and not losing that self.
      Seem too different and you risk being hated and exterminated, conform and you risk being one of them with no voice or reason. 
      We all wear masks; present a person, else they impose a persona thatâ€™s not you.

    <p>
      Far too many live in an illusion wearing a mask trying to fit in, wandering too far away from reality, aimlessly fantasizing about an idealistic world. Losing the sense of self living in delusion, the truth seem alien. 
      The more delusional, the longer the suffering.

      Know yourself.
