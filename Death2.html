      In the midst of grief, he was ignorant of his emotions.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      He chose a certain way to ride it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overtime, he realized it was all an action.
    </p>

    <p>
      The death, grief and healing is deliberate.
    </p>

    <p>
      He shed a few tears, cursed aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      The actions won't stop until he becomes ignorant again.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, it"s not grief.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's death.
    </p>
