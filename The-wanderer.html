    <p>
      Be the wanderer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some are lost, some are simply observing while wandering.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is he who wanders that gets lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be the artist.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you wander and observe, create.
    </p>

    <p>
      While creating, the artist must recognize his foolishness - then utilize it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Always pray for the artist.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more observant you are, the more creative you become.
    </p>
