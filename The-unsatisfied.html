      Why is man so unsatisfied?
    </p>

    <p>
      He never learns to be patient and is always lusting for pleasure even if his whole life, he has had to be patient for everything he has. In his chase for pleasure, he meets his ruin.
    </p>

    <p>
      He needs to realize that he has a responsibility to be the best version of himself but in his constant chase for pleasure, man lies to himself so much for so long by not accepting that fact even though he knows it. Living in the delusion of comfort, he realizes he is actually uncomfortable and then continues to lie to himself until he destroys himself and everything in his path.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, man needs to understand that he needs to do what he has to do and leave the rest because the rest is not up to him.
