	<p>
		How do you silence the voices in your head; drugs, alcohol, women or death?
	</p>

	<p>
		In your weakness, how strong will you be - maybe all you need is awareness because even the strongest man has a weakness.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is dangerous to be weak, predators are ruthless and they bite ferociously but awareness in moments of weakness saves you from the traps laid out - predators are sharp and always on the prowl. 
	</p>


	<p>
		Indulge yourself and your awareness will make you comfortable enough to recharge, you will realize all they want is to be heard and acknowledged.
	</p>

	<p>
		Then they are silent, only to begin again until the silence is permanent.
	</p>

	<p>
		You are the 'voices' in your head - do not wait for them to be loud before you acknowledge them because the most ruthless predator is you.
	</p>
