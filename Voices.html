      How do you silence the voices in your head; drugs, alcohol, women or death
    </p>

    <p>
      In your weakness, how strong will you be - maybe all you need is awareness because even the strongest man has a weakness.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is dangerous if you are weak, predators are ruthless and they bite ferociously but awareness in moments of weakness saves you from the traps laid out - predators are sharp and always on the prowl. 
    </p>


    <p>
      Indulge yourself and your awareness will make you comfortable enough to recharge, you will realize all they want is to be heard and acknowledged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then they are silent, only to begin again until the silence is permanent.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are the 'voices' in your head - do not wait for them to be loud before you acknowledge them because the most ruthless predator is you.
