    Who is God?
    </p>

    <p>
    Look within, you will find Him.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are made in His image but if you consider the propensity of humans to be evil, you wonder if God is too.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A staunch believer could be in serious hardship and observers ask why God wouldn’t relieve him, yet he remains a believer because he believes soon enough, provided he continues to try to improve his situation, he will be relieved and God is happy with him because his faith is unshaken.
    </p>  

    <p>
      If he renounces as the hardship is unbearable, then his faith is not strong enough but God knows all and He knows he will fail so why test him?
    </p>

    <p>
      God’s rewards for a faithful servant is bountiful and a weak believer isn’t deserving.
    </p>  

    <p>
      So if a believer dies in hardship, his rewards are with God.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      How long in hardship then makes even the strongest of believers renounce? We all have a threshold where we fold. God knows all, maybe he sends relief just before that threshold?
    </p>

    <p>
      Do you have faith? Do you believe in God, Yes? Then He will test you. Just like humans put who loves them through series of tests to ascertain the truth about that fact, God does the same.
