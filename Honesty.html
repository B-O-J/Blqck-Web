	<p>
		Being good, honest and loving is only useful for the self. Nobody really cares because most people are out to further their own interests.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It doesn’t matter how much love you extend to people, how hard you work or even how much you pray, you might still suffer.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Life isn’t about what you deserve, it’s about what you earn which is why you need to be ruthlessly selfish about yourself and your interests. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Rely on yourself for comfort and accept your mortality, only then will you be brave enough to stare death in the face and then find joy amidst the suffering. 
		After all life is a short trip and death should be a welcome eventuality.
	</p>

	<p>
		Nobody comes first except you but above all is God.
